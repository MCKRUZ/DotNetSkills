# EY Design Principles for Executive Presentations

## Visual Hierarchy

### 1. Headline Domination
- Headlines should be the largest element on the slide
- Use 40-54pt font size for headlines
- Make headlines visually dominant (2-3x larger than body text)

### 2. Single Message Per Slide
- One key insight per slide
- If you have two messages, make two slides
- The headline should state the message explicitly

### 3. Assertive Headlines
- Every headline must be a complete sentence
- State an insight, not a topic
- Include the "so what?" - why should the audience care?
- Use strong verbs: "enables," "drives," "limits," "creates"

### 4. Evidence-Based Content
- Each assertion must be supported
- Use data, facts, and expert quotes
- Cite sources for credibility
- Visuals should reinforce, not decorate

## Layout Principles

### 5. Visual Scan Order
- Top-left to bottom-right reading flow
- Headline first (top-left)
- Key visual second (center)
- Supporting details third (bottom-right)

### 6. White Space
- Leave breathing room around elements
- Don't crowd content to the edges
- Use white space to guide the eye
- Create visual separation between ideas

### 7. Consistent Alignment
- Left-align text for readability
- Center-align only for titles
- Align visual elements to a grid
- Maintain consistent margins

### 8. Data Visualization
- Chart title should be the insight
- Label axes clearly
- Highlight the key data point
- Remove chart clutter (gridlines, borders)

## Color Usage

### 9. Strategic Color
- Use EY Yellow (#FFDD00) for accents and highlights only
- Primary: EY Navy (#1E1847) for headlines
- Secondary: Black (#000000) for body text
- Gray scale for supporting information

### 10. Color Psychology
- Yellow = attention, optimism, energy (use sparingly)
- Navy = authority, stability, trust (primary)
- Black = sophistication, clarity (body text)

## Typography

### 11. Font Hierarchy
- Headlines: EY Serif or equivalent (40-54pt)
- Subheads: EY Sans Medium (24-30pt)
- Body: EY Sans Regular (18-22pt)
- Captions: EY Sans Light (14-16pt)

### 12. Text Treatment
- Use sentence case for headlines
- Avoid ALL CAPS (hard to read)
- Use bold for emphasis, not decoration
- Italicize quotes only

## Image Usage

### 13. Strategic Imagery
- Images should advance the story
- Use high-resolution, professional photos
- Avoid stock photo clichés
- Crop to focus on key elements

### 14. Diagram Standards
- Use simple, clean diagrams
- Limited color palette (2-3 colors max)
- Clear labels and annotations
- Consistent icon style

## Animation and Transitions

### 15. Minimal Motion
- No transitions between slides
- Simple fade-in for bullet points
- Avoid animation for animation's sake
- Keep total time under 30 seconds per slide

## Accessibility

### 16. Readability
- Minimum 18pt body text
- High contrast between text and background
- Avoid color-only meaning
- Provide text alternatives for visuals

### 17. Print Considerations
- Design for both screen and print
- Test print quality before presentation
- Ensure colors work in grayscale
- Include page numbers on printed versions
