# EY Narrative Frameworks for Executive Presentations

## SCR Framework (Situation - Complication - Resolution)

### When to Use
- **Decisions to be made**: Any presentation asking for approval or buy-in
- **High stakes**: Major investments, transformations, strategic shifts
- **Anticipated resistance**: Challenging status quo or proposing change
- **Complex problems**: Multi-faceted challenges requiring systematic thinking

### Structure

#### Situation (The "What Is")
- Establish current state
- Provide context and background
- Set the stage (get audience nodding)
- Build common ground
- 20% of presentation time

**Example:**
"Global operations span 15 countries with legacy systems from 5 different acquisitions. This fragmentation creates operational complexity and limits our agility."

#### Complication (The "What's Wrong")
- Identify the problem or opportunity
- Create tension and urgency
- Highlight what's at stake
- Quantify the impact
- 30% of presentation time

**Example:**
"Legacy operations limit growth and increase operational risk by 40%. Competitors are moving 2x faster to market, and we're losing $25M annually in inefficiencies."

#### Resolution (The "What To Do")
- Propose the solution
- Outline the approach
- Describe the future state
- Call to action
- 50% of presentation time

**Example:**
"Modernize operations on a unified cloud platform to reduce costs by 30%, accelerate time-to-market by 50%, and enable data-driven decision making. Request: $15M investment to launch 24-month transformation."

## Past - Present - Future Framework

### When to Use

## Problem - Solution Framework

### When to Use
- **Straightforward challenges**: Clear cause-and-effect
- **Technical presentations**: Engineering or operational issues
- **Quick decisions**: Low stakes, rapid approval needed
- **Known solutions**: Proven approach to familiar problems

### Structure

#### Problem
- Clearly define the issue
- Show impact and urgency
- Quantify the pain
- Build need for solution

## Framework Selection Guide

| Framework | Decisions | High Stakes | Resistance | Complexity | Time Allotted |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| SCR | Yes | Yes | Yes | High | 30+ min |
| Past-Present-Future | No | Maybe | No | Medium | 20+ min |
| Problem-Solution | Yes | No | No | Low-Medium | 15+ min |
| Opportunity-Approach | Maybe | No | No | Low-Medium | 15+ min |

## SCR Best Practices

### Situation Section
- Start with facts everyone can agree on
- Use data to establish baseline
- Keep it brief - audience knows their business
- Set up the complication naturally

### Complication Section
- Make the problem feel urgent
- Use contrast: current state vs. desired state
- Quantify the cost of inaction
- Build emotional connection to the problem
- Don't overwhelm with too many issues

### Resolution Section
- Be specific about what you're asking for
- Show how your solution addresses the complication
- Paint a picture of the future state
- Make the call to action clear and immediate
- Provide next steps and timeline

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting with the solution**: Jump straight to resolution without setup
2. **Weak complication**: Problem seems trivial or easily solved
3. **No clear ask**: Resolution doesn't ask for anything specific
4. **Unbalanced time**: Spending too much on situation, not enough on resolution
5. **Missing the "so what"**: Facts without insights or implications
6. **Too many complications**: Dilutes focus and confuses audience

## Testing Your Narrative

Before presenting, ask:
1. **Can I summarize the SCR in 3 sentences?**
2. **Would someone unfamiliar with the situation understand the complication?**
3. **Is the resolution crystal clear with a specific ask?**
4. **Does each slide advance the narrative?**
5. **Is the emotional arc compelling?** (tension → release)
